# MIDIno
MIDI (through standard 5-DIN MIDI cables) to BLE-MIDI bridging with Arduino-compatible boards project.    
This project was inspired by Matt Sieren (sieren) blidino Arduino USB-MIDI to BLE-MIDI project https://github.com/sieren/blidino.

The purpose of this project is to allow MIDI devices that doesn't support USB-MIDI to communicate wires-free through the Midi Manufacturers Association MIDI over Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE-MIDI) protocol.
